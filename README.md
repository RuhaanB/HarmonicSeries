Important Information before using the Simulation

Introduction (Preliminary information):
	
	This is a very simple program written in Python3 (by an amateur at the language) in order to give the average viewer an opportunity to let their dreams go wild and experiment around with the different values of the Harmonic Series and develop their own understanding and intuition of the topics discussed in the very short YouTube video over on the Ruhaan Bhargav channel.

	I, Ruhaan have made and tested this Python script myself and have noticed multiple problems which might be common amongst the users and you should beware off.

Some Limitations and things to remember:

- This script will only work with Python 3 and above. (Written in Python 3.9.1)

- Extremely large numbers (over 10 billion) have a chance of completely giving you the wrong value since the RAM of your or anyone’s device simple cannot store the amount of digits being forced into it.
	In such cases, the computer often spits out the largest number of the inputted function it could compute. Therefore, it is best that you do not push the limits of your computer. Inputs up to a couple million wouldn’t offset the accuracy of the displayed results, however it is very important to keep patient when waiting for your results to be displayed as the said program is relatively inefficient. 

Things required to run:	
	
Python 3 or later

Any IDE or just Python IDLE (Comes with Python3)

If Python IDLE is present. Save the file and run with F5
